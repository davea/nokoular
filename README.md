# Nokoular

A little macOS app that lives in your status bar and links your [Timeular](https://timeular.com/) Zei to
[Noko](http://nokotime.com) for super-simple time tracking.


## Requirements

 - macOS
 - Python 3.6+ (e.g. from [homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/python#default) or [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/), doesn't really matter as long as `python3` is on your `$PATH`)

## Installation

Copy `config.py-example` to `config.py` and edit to suit.

Then run `make` to install requirements and build the app automatically. `Nokoular.app` will be created in `dist/`.
